     Lasers seem to be a promising and versatile emergent technology in the space industry, e.g laser ablation propulsion, where lasers are used to blast materials and make them expel small amounts of material to generate thrust. Ablation has uses in things like debris removal or propulsion. Another propulsion related technology is laser – driven sail technology, which is the same principle as ablation but the pressure of the light from the laser instead drives the sails. The breakthrough Starshot was an experimental project that aimed to do this using an ultralight satellite, and NASA also have considered the idea for future applications.

Lasers are a versatile emerging technology in the spaceflight industry that is being researched for a wide variety of applications in satellites and other spacecraft. A lot of the systems would especially allow for ground – based propulsion, meaning that volatile and/or heavy propulsion systems wouldn’t have to be onboard, allowing for lighter and simpler probes that would be much easier to launch and could also potentially be launched much further – allowing for exploration of deep space in much shorter times than traditional technology. Lasers also have interesting applications in clearing space debris and asteroids. There are many forms that this technology takes on, like sails and laser ablation propulsion, the 2 main subjects that this article will be focussing on.

Laser ablation
     </b>
    </u>
    <br>
Laser ablation propulsion is simply put, when a laser is used to blast and rapidly heat up a propellant, causing its rapid heating and expulsion of small amounts of material, in term generating thrust. Tests show that this is an effective method of propulsion with researchers achieving up to 40km/h jets of the material – enough to generate 1.14N of force from just nanometres of material being expelled. Phipps, C.R, (2024). Laser Propulsion in Space. Elsevier. 
     </p>
   <p>
In terms of propulsion, 1.14N is a lot of thrust, especially for deep space probes, comparing to ion engines for example, that have total thrust under 0.5N. Ferreira, J., Martins, A., Miranda, R., Junior, H., Silva, A., Ferreira, I., Sukhanov, A. and Cabo Winter, O. (2017). Development of a Solar Electric Propulsion System for the First Brazilian Deep Space Mission. This could allow for much faster deep space probes, potentially for rapid exploration or potentially even interstellar travel.
</p>
   <p>
However, propulsion isn’t the only interesting use case for laser ablation propulsion, as it also has applications in space debris removal – something that is becoming more important as spaceflight debris builds up. The debris is all moving at a high velocity – and as the amount of debris increases, the probability that they crash into each other and break into smaller debris increases, meaning that eventually you’d be left with a belt of high – energy particles that would be extremely difficult to launch through. Kessler, D.J. and Cour-Palais, B.G. (1978). Collision frequency of artificial satellites: The creation of a debris belt. Journal of Geophysical Research, 83(A6), pp.2637–2646. A potential solution to this problem could be forcing the debris to re-enter and then burn up in the atmosphere, removing it. However, debris like spent boosters and dead satellites have no propulsion capacity, making them a bit more difficult to deal with as you might have to re- enter them manually using rockets which also can be non – economical and expensive. However, by blasting the debris with high energy lasers, ablation can be used to make the debris propel itself to burn up. This could be achieved using either ground – based laser arrays, or space – based laser arrays. An example of a ground-based system could be the ORION laser that would be able to target space debris and blast it, to remove all debris larger than 1cm and less than 100kg in around only 4 years. Phipps, C.R. et al. (1996) ‘ORION: Clearing near-Earth space debris using a 20-kW, 530-nm, Earth-based, repetitively pulsed laser’, Laser and Particle Beams, 14(1), pp. 1–44. Space – based systems, such as the L’ADROIT orbiting platform, that would use UV pulses to ablate and adjust orbits very efficiently. In some ways it’s better than ground-based systems, as you wouldn’t have to use as large mirrors and as powerful lasers due to both the reduced scattering and the fact that the laser platform would be moving, causing it to naturally interact with more debris. Phipps, C.R. (2014). L׳ADROIT – A spaceborne ultraviolet laser system for space debris clearing. Acta Astronautica, 104(1), pp.243–255.

Laser photon propulsion
     </b>
    </u>
<br>
Another big application of lasers for space applications is laser photon propulsion. This is like laser ablation propulsion, but instead of using the pressure generated by the ejection of material, you instead use the momentum and pressure exerted by the light itself, almost akin to a solar sail. A practical example of where this was being experimentally applied was the breakthrough Starshot. 
</p>
   <p>
The breakthrough Starshot was an experimental program where an array of lasers would fire light at extremely thin and light solar sails, causing them to accelerate extremely fast, reaching .2c in just under 20 minutes. With this speed, the probes would be able to reach Alpha Centauri, the solar system’s closest neighbouring star in just over 20 years of travel. Breakthrough Starshot (2019). Breakthrough Initiatives. While the project ultimately failed due to funding and engineering difficulties, the concept still seems to be relatively viable.
</p>
   <p>
Laser driven solar sail technology is still being researched by space agencies around the world, for example, even NASA have done looks into solar sails, but they argue the technology is still a long way off. The theoretical plans could be that a laser satellite could be put into orbit around the sun, wherein it would use the solar energy and possibly even fusion energy to fire a laser at the probe for acceleration. We would however also need to engineer a lot of new lasers, as current laser technology just simply lacks the power to fire off a laser with enough power to propel the spacecraft. Johnson, L. (2017). From Solar Sails to Laser Sails.

        Conclusions</h3>
    <p class ="exl">
In conclusion, lasers seem to have many useful and practical uses for emergent space technologies, but current real-world application is still theoretical, due to a lot of different technological and engineering challenges. However, I still believe that the technology has the potential to be extremely important to the space industry in future, from debris clearing to ultrafast satellite probes or sail craft.
